##  README: STX Exchange Smart Contract

###  Overview

This Clarity smart contract implements a simple yet secure **on-chain auction system for STX tokens** on the Stacks blockchain. The contract allows the owner to initiate an auction for an item with a specified reserve price and duration, while users can place bids in STX. The highest bidder at the end of the auction wins, and their bid is transferred to the auction owner.

* **Reserve price enforcement**

### üìÑ Deployment Notes

* Make sure `owner` is correctly set upon deployment.
* All amounts are in micro-STX (1 STX = 1,000,000 micro-STX).
* Use `block-height` for time-based logic (each block \~10 minutes).
